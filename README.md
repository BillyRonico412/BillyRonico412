I'm a master's student in computer science at Toulouse's Paul Sabatier University 👨‍🎓 and a freelancer in my spare time. 

I'm a TypeScript 💻 Full Stack developer. I'm versatile and master the various stages involved in creating a web or mobile application. 

From understanding user needs, to frontend and backend development right through to deployment 🚀. In love with the strong typing offered by TypeScript, I'm very interested in tRPC technology.

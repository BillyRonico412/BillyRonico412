## Presentation
I'm a master's student in computer science at Toulouse 🇫🇷 's Paul Sabatier University 👨‍🎓 and a freelancer in my spare time. 
I'm a TypeScript 💻 Full Stack developer. I'm versatile and master the various stages involved in creating a web or mobile application. 
From understanding user needs, to frontend and backend development right through to deployment 🚀. 

In love with the strong typing offered by TypeScript, I'm very interested in tRPC technology.
